**Status**: Unmaintained Legacy Code.
If you want to build upon this, the [PyTorch implementation of the
loss](rodi/pt/losses.py) might be a good starting point.

For a more recent approach to disentangling with up-to-date code, see
[Network-to-Network Translation with Conditional Invertible Neural Networks](https://github.com/CompVis/net2net) (especially Sec. C in the supplementary of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13580)).
